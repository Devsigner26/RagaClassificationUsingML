# üéµ Hindustani Raga Classification using Machine Learning

This project classifies Indian classical ragas based on audio features extracted from sample data. Built entirely using Python in *Google Colab*, this ML model helps music learners and enthusiasts understand the root raga behind songs.

## üîç Features
- Multi-class classification of ragas
- Preprocessing and feature extraction from audio files
- Model training using Scikit-learn and/or TensorFlow
- Visualizations of audio patterns (spectrograms, waveforms)
- Evaluation using accuracy & confusion matrix

## üß† Technologies Used
- Python (Colab)
- NumPy, Pandas
- Librosa (audio processing)
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## üìÅ Dataset
(Dataset is public)

- Source: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ihliCXGEMrvMsQQPeQSlGGI2-8J3dhAA?usp=drive_link]
- Preprocessed using MFCCs and spectral features
